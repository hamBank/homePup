# Definition of mirror hosts we push.
# One mirror per line, with the following fields defined.
#
# Type ShortName HostName User SSHProtocol SSHKeyFile
#
# ALTERNATIVELY the line may look like
#
# Type ShortName HostName User -$SOMESSHOPTION
#
#
# Type is either all or staged, meaning:
# all    - do a "normal" push. Trigger them, go on.
# staged - do a two-stage push, waiting for them after stage 2(and all others that
#          are staged) before doing stage2
#
# ShortName will be used as a shorthand in logfile outputs and for the logfile
# where every ssh output gets redirected to.
#
# If no SSHKeyFile is given, the default from the config file applies.
# If SSHProtocol is empty, it will default to 2, but if you want to
#                define a keyfile you HAVE TO set protocol too!
#
# With the ALTERNATIVE syntax you are able to use any special ssh option
# you want just for one special mirror. The option after the username
# then MUST start with a -, in which case the whole rest of the line is taken
# as a set of options to give to ssh, it is passed through without doing
# anything with it.
#
# There is one caveat here: Should you want to use the -i option to give
# another ssh key to use, keep in mind that the master keyfile will
# always be presented too! That is, ssh will show both keys to the other
# side and the first one presented wins. Which might not be the key you
# want. There is currently no way around this, as that would mean
# dropping backward compatibility.
#
# Examples:
# all eu.puccini puccini.debian.org archvsync 2
#
# will push puccini.debian.org, user archvsync, using ssh protocol 2 and the specified ssh key.
#
#
# all eu.puccini puccini.debian.org archvsync -p 2222
#
# which will do the same as above, but use port 2222 to connect to.
#
# staged eu.puccini puccini.debian.org
# staged eu.powell powell.debian.org
#
# will push both puccini and powell in stage1, waiting for both to
# finish stage1 before stage2 gets pushed.
#
# One special value is allowed: DELAY
# This word has to be on a line itself, followed by a space and a number.
# nothing else, not even whitespace. It will trigger a pause of $number
# seconds between the two mirrors. If no number is given it defaults to
# 600 seconds.
